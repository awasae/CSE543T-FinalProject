In the stock market, predicting the trend of prices is one of the most widely investigated and challenging problem for investors and researchers to solve. Predicting the price of a stock plays an important role when making decisions for buying and selling stocks weather it be in long or short-term. As technology has advanced, our algorithms today can easily accomplish tasks that were recently only performed by experts. Since there are multiple factors in trading market and many different trading behaviours, in this research we explore a promising method of predicting stock prices.  We propose a model called long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network to capture such factors, respectively. This model is based on multiple time scale feature learning to predict the price trend of the stock market index. We will predict whether the S&P 500 will move up or down using the features volatility, return and trading volume as three sets of time sequence data. The proposed LSTM neural network model is seen to more effective as compared to other models on real data sets. Finally, we used area under the curves as a metric to tune hyper-parameters and to be able to measure the accuracy of our model.
